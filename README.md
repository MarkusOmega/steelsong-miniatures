This project is set up with multiple migrations and seeders so it can be set up easily for local development.

# Steelsong miniatures  

Steelsong miniatures is a Company that makes 3D models and this project is going to be the main site.

on this site you will be able to browse through the multitude of Stl miniatures and read the stories connected to them.
They wil also be able to purchase these Stl Files.

the site will also contain a library of lore items. small stories about the miniatures and the fantasy world they are part of.

there is also a sepparate section for news items. a selection of these wil be shown on the main page.

users will get an account that will give them an overview of all Miniatures they have bought and will be able to redownload them.

in the admin area you wil be able to create, edit and delete all the perviously mentioned items.

Content and News items wil have a wysiwyg editor and can be linked to categories.

Content items can also be linked to Products.

the products will have a price and a discount price. wich are formatted to be currency.
and can be linked to categories.

eventualy this wil be a full show and order management system where you can see all orders that have been placed. 

I am planning on adding multiple Api connections. 

So the stl files can be stored on a central cloud storage so that the site stays stable and fast.

i am also planning on adding a connection with google drive where i will be storing the lore and content items.
